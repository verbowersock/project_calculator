# React Inline Edit

Allows you to to make inline/in-place edits to the text rendered inside the component.

Support: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop & mobile) and IE 9+

The new version comes with a simpler API which uses `<textarea>` input elements that auto resize to fit in the text edits.

The [previous version](https://github.com/vasanthk/react-inline-edit/tree/contenteditable-version) (v 1.x.x) of this module used `contenteditable` which was quirky by spec and had various issues.  

## Install

```
$ npm i react-inline-edit
```
